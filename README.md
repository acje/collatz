# Collatz
Collatz conjecture
Unsolved problem in mathematics: Does the Collatz sequence eventually reach 1 for all positive integer initial values?

Consider the following operation on an arbitrary positive integer:

If the number is even, divide it by two. (N/2)
If the number is odd, triple it and add one. (3N+1)
